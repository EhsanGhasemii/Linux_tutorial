## How to make a word upper/lower charactrized? 
In **Neovim (nvim)**, you can easily change the case of selected text. Here are the main ways:

---

### 1. **Using Visual Mode**

1. Select the text:

   * `v` â†’ character-wise selection
   * `V` â†’ line-wise selection
   * `Ctrl+v` â†’ block-wise selection
2. Then:

   * `U` â†’ make it **uppercase**
   * `u` â†’ make it **lowercase**

---

### 2. **Using Normal Mode on a Motion**

You donâ€™t even need to select. You can apply directly:

* `gU<motion>` â†’ uppercase
* `gu<motion>` â†’ lowercase

Examples:

* `gUw` â†’ uppercase the current word
* `guw` â†’ lowercase the current word
* `gU}` â†’ uppercase until end of paragraph
* `guap` â†’ lowercase a paragraph

---

### 3. **With Visual Selection + `gU` / `gu`**

* Select text with `v`, then press `gU` for uppercase or `gu` for lowercase.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Quick example:

* Place cursor on a word
* Type `gUw` â†’ it becomes **ALLCAPS**
* Type `guw` â†’ it becomes lowercase
